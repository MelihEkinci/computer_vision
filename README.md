# Computer Vision Project Collection - Winter Term 2023/24

Welcome to the main repository for the Computer Vision course projects, instructed by Florian Kordon, Mathias Zinnen, and other esteemed faculty members. This repository encompasses five distinct projects, each exploring different aspects and techniques within the field of computer vision.

## Projects Overview

Each sub-project within this repository is designed to tackle a unique challenge in computer vision, ranging from image processing and enhancement to object detection and recognition.

### 1. Image Demosaicing and HDR

- **Description**: Focuses on implementing algorithms for demosaicing images and enhancing them using High Dynamic Range (HDR) techniques.
- [Read More](path/to/demosaicing/HDR/README.md)

### 2. Face Recognition

- **Description**: Develops a system capable of recognizing and re-identifying faces within video streams, leveraging both supervised and unsupervised learning methods.
- [Read More](path/to/face/recognition/README.md)

### 3. Object Detection

- **Description**: Implements the selective search algorithm for object detection, coupled with a pipeline for recognizing objects within images.
- [Read More](path/to/object/detection/README.md)

### 4. Writer Retrieval

- **Description**: Creates a system for writer identification and retrieval, analyzing handwriting samples to match writers.
- [Read More](path/to/writer/retrieval/README.md)

### 5. Box Detection

- **Description**: Estimates the size of a box from distance images using RANSAC for robust plane fitting, addressing challenges in noise sensitivity and measurement accuracy.
- [Read More](path/to/box/detection/RANSAC/README.md)

## Getting Started

To begin exploring these projects, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Navigate into each project's directory to find specific instructions on installation, dependencies, and usage.

## Dependencies

The projects may have varying dependencies, primarily including libraries such as `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, and `opencv-python`. Ensure to check the `requirements.txt` file within each project's directory and install necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contributions

Contributions across any of the sub-projects are highly encouraged. Please refer to the specific guidelines in the respective project's README for more details on contributing.

## License

Each project within this collection is released under the MIT License unless specified otherwise within its directory. Please refer to individual `LICENSE` files for more details.

## Acknowledgments

This collection is the culmination of efforts from students, faculty, and contributors. Special thanks to Florian Kordon, Mathias Zinnen, and all contributing faculty members for guiding these explorations into computer vision.
